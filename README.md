# A* Path Planning Algorihtm on a Visibility Graph Built Using the Rotational Plane Sweep Algorithm

The present code is an implementation of the classical A* path planning algorithm on a Visibility Graph. The Visibility graph vertexes and edges are stored on the directories environmets (vertices) and graph_environments (edges) respectively.

The code implementation has a CLI to execute it as follows.

`python main.py environments/env_X.csv graph_environments/visibility_graph_env_X.csv`  where X is the environment number and it has to be the same for both arguments. An example of execution command is the following.

`python main.py environments/env_X.csv graph_environments/visibility_graph_env_X.csv`
